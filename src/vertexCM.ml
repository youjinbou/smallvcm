(*//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * A NOTE ON PATH MIS WEIGHT EVALUATION
 *//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *
 * We compute path MIS weights iteratively as we trace the light and eye
 * sub-paths. We cache three floating points quantities at each sub-path vertex:
 *
 *   dVCM  dVC  dVM
 *
 * These quantities represent partial weights associated with the sub-path. When
 * we connect or merge one vertex to another, we use these quantities to quickly
 * evaluate the MIS weight for the full path we have constructed. This scheme is
 * presented in the technical report
 *
 *   "Implementing Vertex Connection and Merging"
 *   http://www.iliyan.com/publications/ImplementingVCM
 *
 * The MIS code in the VertexCM class references the corresponding equations in
 * the report in the form
 *
 *   [tech. rep. (##)]
 *
 * where ## is the equation number.
