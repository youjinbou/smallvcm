smallvcm
========

Port of the [smallvcm renderer][1] to ocaml. I made it in order to verify my implementation of 
the mersenne twister random number generator, included in the gmaths library. Should be 
working now. I included the original rngs as well, and a few other command line options.
The report command line parameter is not tested at all (though the code is there).

The code is distributed under the GPL (since gmaths is GPLed). I'll probably provide a version 
following the MIT license later on (it just requires me to strip the gmaths dependency out) - not
sure how this would work out repository wise though.

I also hope to turn it into an interesting playground for multithreading in ocaml in the future.
